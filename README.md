## Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">advent of code from 2022</a>

### Setup

In the `2022inputs`-folder create files `DayXX_Input` where XX denotes the day you want to have solved with leading 0s (XX comes from {01, 02, 03, ..., 22, 23, 24, 25}). In this file you paste your Puzzle Input from the AOC-Website. Then adjust the first value in the Makefile. Afterwards make(or similar command) the project in the commandline.

You can also grab the session key from your browser and insert it in a `.session` file. The code will automatically run the `InputGrabber.jar` and grab the input directly from the website.
